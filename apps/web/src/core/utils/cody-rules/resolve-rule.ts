/**
 * Resolves a Cody rule by UUID using layered lookup strategies.
 *
 * Why this exists: Cody-generated PR comments link to rules via URLs like
 * `/settings/code-review/{repositoryId}/cody-rules/{ruleId}`. The rule
 * detail page also expects `?teamId=...&directoryId=...` in the query
 * string, but those are not present in the generated links, so a naive
 * lookup inside a specific directory/team scope returns nothing and the
 * page redirects away — the "link doesn't even work" complaint.
 *
 * This helper falls back progressively:
 *   1. Look inside the repo (+ directory if provided).
 *   2. Look among inherited rules (if teamId is available).
 *   3. As a last resort, scan every rule in the organization by UUID.
 *
 * Each layer tolerates fetcher errors and tries the next one so a
 * transient failure in one scope does not break the whole resolution.
